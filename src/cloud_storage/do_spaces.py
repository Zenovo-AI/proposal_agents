"""
This module interacts with DigitalOcean Spaces using the `boto3` library to manage files in a
specific space (bucket). It allows listing, uploading, downloading, and deleting files within
a defined folder in the space. This is especially useful for applications that require frequent
file operations on cloud storage.

Key Features:
- Listing files in a specific folder (excluding the folder itself).
- Uploading files to the space, with checks for existing files to avoid duplication.
- Deleting files within a specific folder (but keeping the folder itself).
- Downloading all files from the space to a local directory, with checks to prevent overwriting.
- Deleting all files in the folder.

The module makes use of `streamlit.secrets` to securely store and access DigitalOcean Spaces' access
and secret keys. The folder and bucket configurations are defined as constants at the beginning of
the script, allowing for easy adjustments.

Note:
- The functions `list_files`, `upload_file`, `delete_existing_files`, and `delete_all` offer
  efficient ways to manage files in DigitalOcean Spaces for cloud-based applications.
- The file management operations are designed to handle errors and ensure safe operations in case
  of missing files or other exceptions.
