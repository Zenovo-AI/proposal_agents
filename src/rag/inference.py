"""
This module handles file processing in a Streamlit application, where users can upload files
and links for processing. It processes the files by saving them locally and passing them to
another function (`ingress_file_doc`) that handles the business logic for each file.

Key Features:
- Uploading and saving files locally in a temporary directory.
- Calling an external function (`ingress_file_doc`) to process each uploaded file.
- Handling multiple files at once, as well as accompanying web links, to process them in the 
  specified section.
- Error handling to catch and display both known and unexpected errors during file processing.
- Providing user feedback via Streamlitâ€™s spinner and success/error messages to guide users.

The module uses `pathlib` to manage file paths and `time.sleep` for handling short delays to
provide feedback to the user. File names and paths are stored in `st.session_state` for reference 
across Streamlit sessions.

Note:
- `process_files_and_links` iterates through the list of uploaded files and web links, invoking
  the `process_file` function for each file.
- The `process_file` function saves the file locally, calls `ingress_file_doc` for processing,
  and handles any errors that occur during the process.
- Temporary files are stored in the `./temp_files` directory, which is created if it doesn't exist.

Ensure that `ingress_file_doc` is correctly defined and handles the file processing logic. This
module provides a structured approach for handling file uploads and processing them in a web
application environment.
